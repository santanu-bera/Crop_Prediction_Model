# Crop_Prediction_Model

I have prepared an END TO END PROJECT based on Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning which increases productivity.
Say goodbye to guesswork!
This ML model crunches the numbers and generate tailored crop suggestion for your specific location and soli condition.
This model also helps in optimizing resource utilization by planting crops that thrive in your environment saving water , fertilizer & resources.
This model also plays a vital role in maximizing Yield Potential. With data-driven insights at your fingertips, achieve higher crop yields and boosts profitability season after season.

A special thanks to Deepsankar Bhattacharya, Priyanshu Mondal, Sudipta Dey for the successful completion of the project.
